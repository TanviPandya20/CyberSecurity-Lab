## <p align="center">Introduction</p>
- Zeek (formerly Bro) is an open-source and commercial network monitoring tool (traffic analyser).
- "Zeek (formerly Bro) is the world's leading platform for network security monitoring. Flexible, open-source, and powered by defenders." "Zeek is a passive, open-source network traffic analyser. Many operators use Zeek as a network security monitor (NSM) to support suspicious or malicious activity investigations. Zeek also supports a wide range of traffic analysis tasks beyond the security domain, including performance measurement and troubleshooting."
- The room aims to provide a general network monitoring overview and work with Zeek to investigate captured traffic. This room will expect you to have basic Linux familiarity and Network fundamentals (ports, protocols and traffic data).

### Introduction to Network Monitoring Approaches
- Network monitoring is highly focused on IT assets like uptime (availability), device health and connection quality (performance), and network traffic balance and management (configuration). Monitoring and visualising the network traffic, troubleshooting, and root cause analysis are also part of the Network Monitoring process. 

### Network Security Monitoring
- Network Security Monitoring is focused on network anomalies like rogue hosts, encrypted traffic, suspicious service and port usage, and malicious/suspicious traffic patterns in an intrusion/anomaly detection and response approach.
- Monitoring and visualising the network traffic and investigating suspicious events is a core part of Network Security Monitoring. This model is helpful for security analysts/incident responders, security engineers and threat hunters and covers identifying threats, vulnerabilities and security issues with a set of rules, signatures and patterns. 

### What is ZEEK?
- Zeek is supported by several developers, and Corelight provides an Enterprise-ready fork of Zeek. Therefore this tool is called both open source and commercial.
